## Challenges

### Validating Player Selection
The game validates the player's selection by comparing the character's name and the coordinates that was clicked on with the data stored in Cloud Firestore. Originally, I had implemented the validation logic on the client side, but I considered the possibility that a malicious user could just open up the developer tools, reverse engineer the code and cheat the game. Therefore, I explored several options to keep my app secured.

My first thought was to create an API using Ruby on Rails to handle the validation logic. While it would certainly protect the logic from being exposed, I opted not to use Rails because the goal of this project was to use Firebase or other cloud platforms for the backend. Another option was to use Firebase Cloud Functions that can run the validation logic, but it would require billing registration for the service.

Fortunately, Netlify offers a similar service without billing registration called Netlify Functions. I was able to construct and deploy a function that contains the necessary logic to validate the player's selection. From the client side, an HTTP request can be made to the API endpoint created by the function. The response is then used to update the React state and UI.

```typescript
fetch(`/.netlify/functions/validate-selection?${params}`)
  .then((res) => res.json())
  .then((data) => {
    if (data === null) {
      changeFeedback("Keep looking!");
    } else if (data === clickedName) {
      changeFoundStatus(characterId);
      changeFeedback(`You've found ${clickedName}!`);
    }
});
```

Although the client knows what parameters are passed to the function, it does not know how the function process them. By using a serverless function, I successfully extracted the validation logic away from the client and more importantly, the implementation detail was no longer exposed.
